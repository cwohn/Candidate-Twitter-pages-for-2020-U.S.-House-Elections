This repository contains a csv which lists candidates in the 2020 U.S. House Elections and the associated twitter pages, if any. The information is scraped from the website Ballotpedia. 

My plan was to also collect all tweets made by these accountss between May 3rd 2020 and November 3rd 2020. I wanted to use analyze these tweets to see if I could find any trends connecting candidates' use of Twitter to their electoral success or party affiliation (e.g. What is the average sentiment of Tweets from Democratcs and Republicans? Do succesful candidates tweet more often? Can we build a model to predict the party affiliation or home state of a candidate?). However, the official Twitter API does not allow me to collect tweets older than a week. The library GetOldTweets3 provides that functuality, but stopped working in September of last year. For now, this project is on hold. 

The code to scrape the data doesn't work in certain cases (it scans over a thousand webpages, and some of them break the formatting conventions the others). In as many of these cases as I can identify, I have corrected the mistakes of the code manually. Almost all of the mistakes were the result of write-in candidates who recived very few votes. Some of these candidates ran in multiple districts, which I didn't think was legal.
